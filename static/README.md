# Static Assets

## Logo File
The website header references a logo file at `static/logo.png`.

**Requirements:**
- File name: `logo.png`
- Format: PNG image
- Recommended dimensions: 48x48 pixels or larger
- Alt text: "M.A Engineering Logo"

**Current Status:** 
- Logo file is missing
- Header will show broken image icon until logo is added

**To add logo:**
1. Create or obtain your company logo
2. Save it as `logo.png` in this folder
3. Ensure it's a PNG format image
4. The website will automatically display it in the header

**Alternative:**
If you don't have a logo yet, you can temporarily comment out the logo line in the HTML files and use just the company name.
